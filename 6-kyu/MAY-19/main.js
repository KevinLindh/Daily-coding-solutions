/*
Run-length encoding (RLE) is a very simple form of data compression in which runs of data (that is, sequences in which the same data value occurs in many consecutive data elements) are stored as a single data value and count, rather than as the original run. Wikipedia

Task

Your task is to write such a run-length encoding. For a given string, return a list (or array) of pairs (or arrays) [ (i1, s1), (i2, s2), â€¦, (in, sn) ], such that one can reconstruct the original string by replicating the character sx ix times and concatening all those strings. Your run-length encoding should be minimal, ie. for all i the values si and si+1 should differ.
Examples

As the article states, RLE is a very simple form of data compression. It's only suitable for runs of data, as one can see in the following example:

runLengthEncoding("hello world!")
 //=>      [[1,'h'], [1,'e'], [2,'l'], [1,'o'], [1,' '], [1,'w'], [1,'o'], [1,'r'], [1,'l'], [1,'d'], [1,'!']]

It's very effective if the same data value occurs in many consecutive data elements:

runLengthEncoding("aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabbb")
 // => [[34,'a'], [3,'b']]
*/

//My solution
var runLengthEncoding = function(str){
  let newArr = str.split("");
  let answer = [];
  let count = 1;
  for(let i = 0; i < newArr.length; i++){
    if(newArr[i] === newArr[i+1]){
      count++;
    } else {
      answer.push([count, newArr[i]]);
      count = 1;
    }
  }
  return answer;
}
