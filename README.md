To start of the day, I spend 1 hour solving CodeWars Katas! 

## Optimizations

I consistently go back and look at more optimal solutions to my code, sometimes for efficiency, sometimes for readability. 

## Lessons Learned:

Breaking a problem into smaller subsets of problems make even the larger and more complex problems manageable. To master a programming language is a long journey and the only way to improve is by taking initiative and trying out new methods and approaches.
