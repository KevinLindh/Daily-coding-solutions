/*
A stealthy burglar is causing a big headache for people in a town. He is known to be swift in getting in the house unnoticed and steal all the diamonds from the locker. He holds a bag in one hand and picks the diamonds from other hand, while stealing.
Kata

Your objective - if choose to accept - is to calculate and return an integer representing the minimum number of repetitions required for the burglar to pick all the diamonds from the locker.
Input

locker - An array of strings representing a single locker. The length of the array will be between 1 - 10 (inclusive): 1 <= locker <= 10.

['*.*.*.*.*.',
 '...*..**..',
 '**.**...*.',
 '**..**..**']

Every item indicates a row and has a length of exact 10

Notations:
. = An empty space
* = A Diamond!

Useful Info

    The burglar steals a single diamond every time but can steal two if diamonds are horizontally adjacent to each other.
    The burglar cannot steal more than two diamonds at once.
    A row in the locker can have 0 diamonds.
    The locker will have at least 1 diamond in it.
    All the inputs are valid.

Example

`locker` array:
['*.*.*.*.*.',
 '...*..**..',
 '**.**...*.',
 '**..**..**']

From top:

    1st row - burglar needs 5 repetitions
    2nd row - needs only 2 repetitions, because both 2nd and 3rd diamond can be grabbed at once since they are horizontally adjacent.
    3rd row - needs 3 repetitions
    4th row - needs 3 repetitions

    So, the burglar needs a minimum of 13 repetitions to steal all the diamonds.

//My solution
function diamondBurglar(locker){
  let repetitions = 0;
  for(let i = 0; i < locker.length; i++){
    let adjacent = false;
    let search = locker[i].split("");
    for(let j = 0; j < search.length; j++){
    if(adjacent && search[j] === "*"){
      adjacent = false;
    } else if(search[j] === "."){
      adjacent = false;
    } else {
      repetitions++;
      adjacent = true
    }
  }
  }
  return repetitions;
}
