/*
In JavaScript there are truthy and falsy values:

    truthy: a value that when evaluated in a boolean context returns true
    falsy: a value that when evaluated in a boolean context returns false

    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy

Your task

You are given two empty arrays (truthy and falsy) and you have to fill this array with at least 5 elements in each which will evaluate to true or false accordingly.

//My solution
const truthy = [1,2,3,4,5];
const falsy = [0, null, false, NaN, undefined];
