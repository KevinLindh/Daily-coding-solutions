Puzzle

If you don't know who Waldo is, he's a nice guy who likes to be in crowded places. But he's also a bit odd as he always likes to hide in plain sight. Can you spot Waldo in the crowd?
Task

Given crowd, an array of strings of equal length, representing a crowded place, return an array with two integers representing the coordinates [y, x] where Waldo can be found ([0, 0] is top-left, y being the row and x being the column ).
Examples

We've spotted Waldo a couple of times in the past. Below is what we found out. Note that he's been in much more crowded places lately.
#1 Waldo at the beach

"             "          Air
"         w   "           Air with a bird
"   w         "           Air with a bird
"~~~~~~~~~~~~~"           Sea
".~..~~.~~~..~"           Waves on beach
"...P......P.."           Beach with some people
"......P..P..."           Beach with some people
"..PW........."           Beach with Waldo and presumably a friend next to him

Unredacted report: Waldo can be found at [7, 3], wearing his usual outfit
#2 Waldo visiting the Great Pyramid

"                              "          Air
"                              "           Air
"            _                 "           Top of pyramid
"          _____               "           Layer of pyramid
"        _________             "           Layer of pyramid
"  B  _______________   G   GG "           Ground layer of pyramid with several people, including Waldo

Unredacted report: Waldo can be found at [5, 2], wearing special clothes protecting him from the sun
Hints

- he isn't always wearing his usual clothes

- why is there more than one bird in the first example ...

//My solution
function findWaldo(crowd) {
  let unique = {};
  for(let i = 0; i < crowd.length; i++){
    let newArr = crowd[i].split("");
    for(let j = 0; j < newArr.length; j++){
      if(unique[newArr[j]]){
        unique[newArr[j]]++;
      } else {
        unique[newArr[j]] = 1;
      }
    }
  }
  let waldo = Object.keys(unique).filter(val => unique[val] === 1)[0];
  for(let i = 0; i < crowd.length; i++){
    let newArr = crowd[i].split("");
    for(let j = 0; j < newArr.length; j++){
      if(newArr[j] === waldo){
        return [i, j];
      }
    }
  }
}
