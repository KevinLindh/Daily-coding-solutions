/*
You have an array of non-negative integers. You need to calculate the difference between the 1st biggest number and the 2nd biggest number of the array.

    diffBig2([10, 5, 2]);

In this case, the 1st biggest number is 10 and the 2nd biggest number is 5. So, the function returns 5, the result of 10 - 5.

You can assume that the input array has 2 or more elements.

The input array has the sort method disabled, so you will have to solve it in another way.
*/

//My solution
function diffBig2(arr) {
  let biggest = Math.max(...arr);
  arr.splice(arr.indexOf(biggest), 1);
  let second = Math.max(...arr)
  return biggest - second;
}
