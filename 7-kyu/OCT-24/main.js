Task

Below we will define what and n-interesting polygon is and your task is to find its area for a given n.

A 1-interesting polygon is just a square with a side of length 1. An n-interesting polygon is obtained by taking the n - 1-interesting polygon and appending 1-interesting polygons to its rim side by side. You can see the 1-, 2- and 3-interesting polygons in the picture below.

Example

For n = 1, the output should be 1;

For n = 2, the output should be 5;

For n = 3, the output should be 13.
Input/Output

    [input] integer n

    Constraints: 1 â‰¤ n < 10000.

    [output] an integer

    The area of the n-interesting polygon.

//My solution
function shapeArea(n) {
    return 2*Math.pow(n,2) - 2*n + 1;
}
