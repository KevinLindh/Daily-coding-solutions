/*
Calculate how many times a number can be divided by a given number.
Example

For example the number 6 can be divided by 2 two times:

1. 6 / 2 = 3
2. 3 / 2 = 1 remainder = 1

100 can be divided by 2 six times:

1. 100 / 2 = 50
2. 50 / 2 = 25
3. 25 / 2 = 12 remainder 1
4. 12 / 2 = 6
5. 6 / 2 = 3
6. 3 / 2 = 1 remainder 1
*/

//My solution
const divisions = (n, divisor) => {
  let count = 0;
  while(n > 1){
    n = Math.floor(n/divisor);
    if(n < 1){
      count--;
    }
    count++;
  }
  return count
};
