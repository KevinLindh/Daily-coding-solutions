/*
The Stanton measure of an array is computed as follows: count the number of occurences for value 1 in the array. Let this count be n. The Stanton measure is the number of times that n appears in the array.

Write a function which takes an integer array and returns its Stanton measure.
Examples

The Stanton measure of [1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2] is 3, because 1 occurs 2 times in the array and 2 occurs 3 times.

The Stanton measure of [1, 4, 1, 2, 11, 2, 3, 1] is 1, because 1 occurs 3 times in the array and 3 occurs 1 time.

//My solution
function stantonMeasure(num){
  let ones = num.filter(val => val === 1);
  return num.filter(val => val === ones.length).length;
}
