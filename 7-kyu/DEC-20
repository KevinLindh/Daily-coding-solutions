/*
Given a non-empty array of integers, find the maximum product of elements from all available sequences.

A sequence here is any pattern in which the elements are equally spaced apart in the array.

The sequence should start at its place in the array: for example, the sequence of 3 elements apart should start at the third element.

Example:

Given the array [11, 6, -2, 0, 5, -4, 2]

When the sequence is 1 element apart: Product = 11 × 6 × (-2) × 0 × 5 × (-4) × 2 = 0.

When the sequence is 2 apart: Product = 6 × 0 × (-4) = 0.

When the sequence is 3 apart: Product = (-2) × (-4) = 8.

When the sequence is 4 apart: Product = 0

When the sequence is 5 apart: Product = 5

When the sequence is 6 apart: Product = -4.

When the sequence is 7 apart: Product = 2.

So, the function should return 8.

//My solution
function findMaxProduct(arr){
  let sums = [];
  for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
    let temp = 1;
    for(let j = i; j < arr.length; j+= i + 1){
        temp *= arr[j];
    }
    sums.push(temp);
  }
  return Math.max(...sums);
}
