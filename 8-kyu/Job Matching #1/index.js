Let's build a matchmaking system that helps discover jobs for developers based on a number of factors.

One of the simplest, yet most important factors is compensation. As developers we know how much money we need to support our lifestyle, 
so we generally have a rough idea of the minimum salary we would be satisfied with.

Let's give this a try. We'll create a function match which takes a candidate and a job, 
which will return a boolean indicating whether the job is a valid match for the candidate.

A candidate will have a minimum salary, so it will look like this:

let candidate = {
  minSalary: 120000
}

A job will have a maximum salary, so it will look like this:

let job = {
  maxSalary: 140000
}

If either the candidate's minimum salary or the job's maximum salary is not present, throw an error.

For a valid match, the candidate's minimum salary must be less than or equal to the job's maximum salary. 
However, let's also include 10% wiggle room (deducted from the candidate's minimum salary) in case the candidate 
is a rockstar who enjoys programming on Codewars in their spare time. The company offering the job may be able to work something out.

//My solution
function match(candidate, job) {
  if(isNaN(candidate.minSalary) || isNaN(job.maxSalary)){
    throw new Error("");
  } else {
    if(candidate.minSalary-candidate.minSalary*0.1 <= job.maxSalary){
      return true;
    } else {
      return false;
    }
  }
}
